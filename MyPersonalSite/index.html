        <h3>Basic HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML served as a stepping stone into my Coding Journey, its easy to understand syntax allowed me to apply similar thought processes into learning other Languages like CSS. i am Currently learning the JavaScript Language.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p class="skill-descr-2">Python has always been a Language i had been interested in learning, it is also a Language many other more experienced Coders had recommended for me. The Python Journey has been a rather turbulant one, because i had been trying to memorize Syntax, as opposed to understanding the Logic behind the Code. One of the short term goals i have set for myself is to acquire the Junior Python Certification(PCEP).</p>
